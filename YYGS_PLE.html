<h1>Yale Young Global Scholars Programme (Politics, Law, Economics)<h1><br>
<h4>The YYGS programme is the most diverse programme that I took part in. <br>
    I got to meet and interact with people from all over the world. It was<br>
    a very unique academic programme where I go to learn about a lot of <br>
    different perspectives. <br><br>

    There were many discussions predicated on topics like the architecture<br>
    of captivity, the monopolies of the past and present, cross-cultural<br> 
    communication and many more. Participating in the discussions and also<br>
    listening to others share their experiences and views was great. It <br>
    broadened my perspectives and made me understand many concepts in ways <br>
    that I could never have imagined. <br><br>

    Also, the teachers had very interesting presentations and activities<br>
    prepared for all participants. Presentations which provided a great <br>
    deal of relevant information on various topics which are of importance <br>
    to the world were presented to us and the breakout discussions after <br>
    the presentations ensured that the learnings from the presentations<br>
    remained in the learnersâ€™ memory.<br><br>

    The overall programme allowed me to see multiple processes, mechanism<br>
    and systems in a new light and expanded my knowledge at the same time.<br>
    It also inspired me to explore more and to feed the fire of my curiosity.
